            <p>
                In order to provide you with the best service and support at reasonable pricing, we do not sell our photographs. We license their use. 
                The fee quoted is especially dependent on 
                (1) payment of the invoice in full, 
                (2) using the photographs only as indicated, and 
                (3) protecting them with proper copyright notification. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>This service agreement is a limited license photo release.  </li>
                <li>Images delivered are licensed to the listing broker for:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The purpose of listing a property only. </li>
                        <li>Term of the listing, not to exceed 1 year.</li>
                    </ol>
                   </li>
                <li>A primary photo can be used for a longer duration and for additional “sold” marketing materials.</li>
                <li>Your rights permit you to post our photographs on multiple listing services and make the images available in your MLS and syndicated listings for the property. </li>
                <li>However, your rights do not permit third-parties to copy,
                    display or distribute our photographs for the purpose of providing services competitive with the products you have purchased from us unless we give you our written permission. </li>
                <li>Only the listing broker has permission to use the delivered images on any electronic or printed form of advertisement for the promotion of the property. </li>
                <li>If anyone (Builders, stagers, designers, or “third parties”) asks to use the images, you agree to refer them to us. 
                    If we agree to allow others to use the images, additional licensing fees may be required. </li>
                <li>For image integrity, and quality control we ask that Images not be altered once delivered.</li>
                <li>Please contact us for an additional release for any/all printed or web publications. Fees may apply. </li>
                <li>Photo credit must be given to True Reflections Media when used on any and all social media sites. </li>
                <li>Images cannot/will not be made available to another broker who takes over an expired or withdrawn listing.  </li>
                <li>Unauthorized use of images is a copyright violation, and will result in termination of this contract.</li>
